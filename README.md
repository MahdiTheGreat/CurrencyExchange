# CurrencyExchange

The purpose of this project is to use live data in the program. In the designed currency conversion program, the user is allowed to easily convert money between different currencies. Rial, US dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, Euro, and UAE dirham currencies are supported in this program. For each currency, there is a display text/enter text field that displays the equivalent of the amount in that currency, and next to that is the flag of the country that represents that currency.

In this program, the user can enter a number in the field related to each currency, and as soon as that number changes, its equivalent in other currencies must be calculated and displayed. For example, if the number 10 is entered in the dollar input, the equivalent of 10 dollars will be calculated in other currencies and displayed, like below:
